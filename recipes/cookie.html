    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup granulated sugar (100 g)</li><br>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar (165 g), packed</li><br>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li><br>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter (115 g), melted</li><br>
        <li>1 large egg</li><br>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><br>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour (155 g)</li><br>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li><br>
        <li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks (110 g)</li><br>
        <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk (110 g), or your preference</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges have started to barely brown.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Cool completely before serving.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Enjoy!
        </li><br>
