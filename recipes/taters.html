    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            On a cutting board, peel the potatoes. Place the potatoes in a large bowl of cold water after peeling to avoid discoloration.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Cut the potatoes into 1-inch (2 cm) cubes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Add the potatoes to a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 12 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            In a small saucepan, bring the milk, heavy cream, and garlic to a simmer over low heat.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Remove the pot from the heat and strain the cream through a fine mesh sieve.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Drain the potatoes in a colander and transfer back to the pot.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Mash the potatoes with a potato masher, potato ricer, or by pushing through a fine mesh sieve with a spatula.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Add the cubed cold butter and salt. Stir to combine.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Gradually add the cream mixture to the potatoes, little by little, until fully incorporated.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Top with freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle with chives and serve.
